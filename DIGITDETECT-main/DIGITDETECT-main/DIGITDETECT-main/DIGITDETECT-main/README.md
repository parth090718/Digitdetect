# DigitDetect - Handwritten Digit Recognition

DigitDetect is a GUI-based desktop application for recognizing handwritten digits using a deep learning model. It allows users to draw digits on a canvas and instantly predicts the digit with high accuracy. The project leverages TensorFlow for the machine learning model and Tkinter for the user interface.

## Features
- **Real-time digit recognition**: Draw a digit on the canvas and get instant predictions.
- **High accuracy**: Achieves up to 98% accuracy using a TensorFlow deep learning model.
- **User-friendly interface**: Simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter.
- **Visual feedback**: Displays prediction results and confidence scores using Matplotlib.
- **Efficient preprocessing**: Utilizes OpenCV and ImageGrab for fast image capturing and processing.
